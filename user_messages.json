The Average Hourly Earnings Y/Y is expected at 3.7% vs 3.7% prior, while the M/M figure is seen at 0.3% vs 0.3% prior.\n\nNeedless to say, this is very old news by now but it might still matter for the market given that we don't get any other NFP report until December 16, which is unfortunately after the December FOMC meeting. The December cut probabilities now stand at just 25% following the update from the BLS that we will get the November NFP only on December 16. \n\nWe should also get the most recent Jobless Claims data alongside the NFP report, and those might actually be more important. \n\nThe Initial Claims are expected at 230K, while the Continuing Claims are seen at 1951K."

The gain was mainly driven by a four-point rise in the major purchase index, which measures confidence in buying big-ticket items, to -12. Expectations for the general economic situation over the next 12 months also climbed two points to -30, while the outlook for personal finances slipped one point to +3."

The Dutch central bank (DNB) published a piece that highlights the risks to markets given the significant flows anticipated. According to DNB, market analysts anticipate funds will reduce their government bond and swap holdings with maturities of more than 25 years by €100bn to €150bn. Without further specification, DNB suggests that these estimates correspond to approximately the average flows in swap markets for a regular month."

Despite major macro shifts over the past decade — from negative interest rates to post-pandemic tightening — the structural allocation to gold has not changed materially.\n\nHowever, the current global investment climate presents a notably different backdrop:\n • Elevated geopolitical uncertainty (U.S.–China trade realignments, Middle East tensions, and rising nuclear risk rhetoric)\n • Persistently high fiscal deficits across major economies, leading to currency debasement fears\n • Increasing volatility in both equity and bond markets due to diverging monetary policies\n • Declining real yields and renewed expectations of monetary easing in 2026\n\nGiven these factors, even a marginal portfolio realignment — an increase of just 2–5% in gold allocation — across institutional or high-net-worth portfolios could generate significant incremental demand. For context, every 1% shift in global asset allocation toward gold represents hundreds of tonnes of additional demand, which historically has had a multiplicative price impact due to the market’s limited float and thin elasticity.\nEstimated target for end-2025\nPutting all this together, a reasonable base-case target could be in the US $4,200-$4,600/oz range by end-2025, assuming no major shock."

The full text will not be available until the plan is formally approved at the Two Sessions next year. This plan will offer some insight into how China plans to navigate an increasingly difficult external environment. Investors will likely watch closely for signs of concrete steps to boost consumption, as well as areas for tech development and focus. \n\nThe long-awaited and high-stakes Xi-Trump meeting next week in South Korea looks likely to take place despite the recent escalations in US-China friction. Language and signalling suggest that both sides would prefer to reach some sort of agreement to continue the current uneasy truce rather than see a re-escalation back to, or beyond, this year's peak tensions in April-May. The odds of miscalculation remain, though, representing a potential downside risk to the outlook. While we see a diminishing marginal impact from further tariff hikes, the prospects of non-tariff escalations represent a notable uncertainty."

The main reason is a continued slide in food prices down to -4.4% YoY, a 20-month low. This is, in part, base effect-driven, as MoM prices actually picked up 0.7%. The primary culprit has been pork (-17%), which is currently in a downward trend and likely to continue dragging food inflation for several more months. On a YoY basis, we continued to see notable drags from vegetable (-13.7%), egg (-11.9%), and fruit (-4.2%) prices despite MoM gains for each of these categories. The drag from these categories may persist in October, but should ease from November onward, helping to support a turnaround of food inflation. \n\nThe silver lining in the data was that non-food inflation picked up to 0.7% YoY, up for a fourth consecutive month despite a -0.1% MoM dip."

Standard error itself is perhaps 50 K.\n- Breakeven rate of job growth has come down a great deal.\n- Range of plausible numbers could go to negative given the 50K standard error\n- The fact the unemployment rate has barely moved is quite remarkable.\n- Research points to longer legs for policy to influence jobs and inflation."
