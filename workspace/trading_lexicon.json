      "China CPI inflation edged up but remained in deflation China's CPI inflation edged up in September, but the economy remained in deflation. The main reason is a continued slide in food prices down to -4.4% YoY, a 20-month low. This is, in part, base effect-driven, as MoM prices actually picked up 0.7%. The primary culprit has been pork (-17%), which is currently in a downward trend and likely to continue dragging food inflation for several more months. On a YoY basis, we continued to see notable drags from vegetable (-13.7%), egg (-11.9%), and fruit (-4.2%) prices despite MoM gains for each of these categories. The drag from these categories may persist in October, but should ease from November onward, helping to support a turnaround of food inflation. The silver lining in the data was that non-food inflation picked up to 0.7% YoY, up for a fourth consecutive month despite a -0.1% MoM dip."

The full text will not be available until the plan is formally approved at the Two Sessions next year. This plan will offer some insight into how China plans to navigate an increasingly difficult external environment. Investors will likely watch closely for signs of concrete steps to boost consumption, as well as areas for tech development and focus. The long-awaited and high-stakes Xi-Trump meeting next week in South Korea looks likely to take place despite the recent escalations in US-China friction. Language and signalling suggest that both sides would prefer to reach some sort of agreement to continue the current uneasy truce rather than see a re-escalation back to, or beyond, this year's peak tensions in April-May.

      "China CPI inflation edged up but remained in deflation China's CPI inflation edged up in September, but the economy remained in deflation. The main reason is a continued slide in food prices down to -4.4% YoY, a 20-month low. This is, in part, base effect-driven, as MoM prices actually picked up 0.7%. The primary culprit has been pork (-17%), which is currently in a downward trend and likely to continue dragging food inflation for several more months. On a YoY basis, we continued to see notable drags from vegetable (-13.7%), egg (-11.9%), and fruit (-4.2%) prices despite MoM gains for each of these categories. The drag from these categories may persist in October, but should ease from November onward, helping to support a turnaround of food inflation. The silver lining in the data was that non-food inflation picked up to 0.7% YoY, up for a fourth consecutive month despite a -0.1% MoM dip."

However, the current global investment climate presents a notably different backdrop: • Elevated geopolitical uncertainty (U.S.–China trade realignments, Middle East tensions, and rising nuclear risk rhetoric) • Persistently high fiscal deficits across major economies, leading to currency debasement fears • Increasing volatility in both equity and bond markets due to diverging monetary policies • Declining real yields and renewed expectations of monetary easing in 2026 Given these factors, even a marginal portfolio realignment — an increase of just 2–5% in gold allocation — across institutional or high-net-worth portfolios could generate significant incremental demand. For context, every 1% shift in global asset allocation toward gold represents hundreds of tonnes of additional demand, which historically has had a multiplicative price impact due to the market’s limited float and thin elasticity.

However, the current global investment climate presents a notably different backdrop: • Elevated geopolitical uncertainty (U.S.–China trade realignments, Middle East tensions, and rising nuclear risk rhetoric) • Persistently high fiscal deficits across major economies, leading to currency debasement fears • Increasing volatility in both equity and bond markets due to diverging monetary policies • Declining real yields and renewed expectations of monetary easing in 2026 Given these factors, even a marginal portfolio realignment — an increase of just 2–5% in gold allocation — across institutional or high-net-worth portfolios could generate significant incremental demand. For context, every 1% shift in global asset allocation toward gold represents hundreds of tonnes of additional demand, which historically has had a multiplicative price impact due to the market’s limited float and thin elasticity. Estimated target for end-2025 Putting all this together, a reasonable base-case target could be in the US $4,200-$4,600/oz range by end-2025, assuming no major shock.",
      "The most important comment from US Trade Representative Greer Yesterday, we got a strong rebound in the US stock markets.

The key focus for policymakers looks little changed, as modernisation, innovation, self-sufficiency, and boosting domestic demand feature prominently. China's next Five-Year Plan continues to focus on key themes and moderate growth The goal to have per capita GDP reach the level of a \"moderately developed economy\" was also mentioned, which, in conjunction with previous goals to double the size of the economy between 2020 and 2035, continues to imply an emphasis on maintaining growth of 4-5% in the coming decade. Industrial modernisation, tech self-sufficiency and innovation feature prominently We have seen a bit of a shift in the order of priorities compared to the 14th Five-Year Plan. Following the broader economic and social development targets, building a modern industrial system and strengthening the real economy was the first broad category mentioned, followed by technological self-sufficiency and innovation, and then building a strong domestic market.",

The first 50% of the rally might have started due to CNBC announcing that US Trade Representative Greer would appear on TV. But let's also say that it might have been just a technical dip-buying move as prices fell into the Friday's lows at the cash open. Now, Greer didn't really say anything new but he did deliver two key comments: - We always watch the stock and bond markets. - We want to make sure the market responds to appropriate info. That second comment is key. It sounds like they don't want the market to think this is going to be another April. They want the market to keep expecting a de-escalation."

Here, betting markets expect the government to remain closed into November. The hottest topic for financial markets right now is US-China relations ahead of some key dates. Presidents Trump and Xi are meant to be meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Korea in the 29-31 October window.

China's next Five-Year Plan continues to focus on key themes and moderate growth The goal to have per capita GDP reach the level of a \"moderately developed economy\" was also mentioned, which, in conjunction with previous goals to double the size of the economy between 2020 and 2035, continues to imply an emphasis on maintaining growth of 4-5% in the coming decade. Industrial modernisation, tech self-sufficiency and innovation feature prominently We have seen a bit of a shift in the order of priorities compared to the 14th Five-Year Plan. Following the broader economic and social development targets, building a modern industrial system and strengthening the real economy was the first broad category mentioned, followed by technological self-sufficiency and innovation, and then building a strong domestic market.",
      "GDP growth slowed by less than expected in 3Q25 - China's GDP grew by 4.8% YoY (missing the5% target) in the third quarter, slowing for a second consecutive quarter from the 5.2% growth in the second quarter. - Still, the economy managed to beat expectations for a steeper decline. - Through the first three quarters of the year, China's economy has grown by 5.2% YoY. - By industry, China's tertiary industry drove growth in 3Q25 with a 5.4% YoY growth, comfortably outpacing growth in the secondary (4.2%) and primary (4.0%) industries. - The better-than-expected GDP data was likely thanks in part to a strong bounce-back in industrial production to 6.5% YoY in September, which is benefiting from resilient external demand. - Yet, soft monthly activity data throughout the quarter suggests that a favourable boost from the GDP deflator may have contributed to this performance."

      "Euro rates: Risks around Dutch pension reforms The Dutch central bank acknowledges risks to interest rates linked to the 1 January 2026 transition of Dutch pension funds, but also sees mitigants to prevent market stress. The 10s30s has more room to steepen from a structural perspective, but we don't fully discount the probability of seeing some flattening in January. Dutch pension reforms bring volatility to long end, but market stress unlikely The 10s30s curve has stabilised to around 25bp over the past month, but with the Dutch pension fund reforms on our doorstep, we doubt that stability can hold. The Dutch central bank (DNB) published a piece that highlights the risks to markets given the significant flows anticipated. According to DNB, market analysts anticipate funds will reduce their government bond and swap holdings with maturities of more than 25 years by €100bn to €150bn. Without further specification, DNB suggests that these estimates correspond to approximately the average flows in swap markets for a regular month.",
      "Historically, gold’s share in large institutional and sovereign portfolios has remained remarkably stable — typically in the range of 8–12% for diversified funds and 3–5% for traditional multi-asset portfolios. Despite major macro shifts over the past decade — from negative interest rates to post-pandemic tightening — the structural allocation to gold has not changed materially. However, the current global investment climate presents a notably different backdrop: • Elevated geopolitical uncertainty (U.S.–China trade realignments, Middle East tensions, and rising nuclear risk rhetoric) • Persistently high fiscal deficits across major economies, leading to currency debasement fears • Increasing volatility in both equity and bond markets due to diverging monetary policies • Declining real yields and renewed expectations of monetary easing in 2026 Given these factors, even a marginal portfolio realignment — an increase of just 2–5% in gold allocation — across institutional or high-net-worth portfolios could generate significant incremental demand. For context, every 1% shift in global asset allocation toward gold represents hundreds of tonnes of additional demand, which historically has had a multiplicative price impact due to the market’s limited float and thin elasticity. Estimated target for end-2025 Putting all this together, a reasonable base-case target could be in the US $4,200-$4,600/oz range by end-2025, assuming no major shock.",

      "Fourth Plenum, Xi-Trump summit, and PBOC are potential catalysts to watch The stronger-than-expected third-quarter data mean that, barring a dramatic deceleration in 4Q, China will likely manage to reach its full-year target of \"around 5%\" growth. Domestically, the Fourth Plenum meetings this week are likely to give some insights into China's 15th Five-Year Plan. The full text will not be available until the plan is formally approved at the Two Sessions next year. This plan will offer some insight into how China plans to navigate an increasingly difficult external environment. Investors will likely watch closely for signs of concrete steps to boost consumption, as well as areas for tech development and focus. The long-awaited and high-stakes Xi-Trump meeting next week in South Korea looks likely to take place despite the recent escalations in US-China friction. Language and signalling suggest that both sides would prefer to reach some sort of agreement to continue the current uneasy truce rather than see a re-escalation back to, or beyond, this year's peak tensions in April-May. The odds of miscalculation remain, though, representing a potential downside risk to the outlook.

Despite major macro shifts over the past decade — from negative interest rates to post-pandemic tightening — the structural allocation to gold has not changed materially. However, the current global investment climate presents a notably different backdrop: • Elevated geopolitical uncertainty (U.S.–China trade realignments, Middle East tensions, and rising nuclear risk rhetoric) • Persistently high fiscal deficits across major economies, leading to currency debasement fears • Increasing volatility in both equity and bond markets due to diverging monetary policies • Declining real yields and renewed expectations of monetary easing in 2026 Given these factors, even a marginal portfolio realignment — an increase of just 2–5% in gold allocation — across institutional or high-net-worth portfolios could generate significant incremental demand. For context, every 1% shift in global asset allocation toward gold represents hundreds of tonnes of additional demand, which historically has had a multiplicative price impact due to the market’s limited float and thin elasticity.

Despite major macro shifts over the past decade — from negative interest rates to post-pandemic tightening — the structural allocation to gold has not changed materially. However, the current global investment climate presents a notably different backdrop: • Elevated geopolitical uncertainty (U.S.–China trade realignments, Middle East tensions, and rising nuclear risk rhetoric) • Persistently high fiscal deficits across major economies, leading to currency debasement fears • Increasing volatility in both equity and bond markets due to diverging monetary policies • Declining real yields and renewed expectations of monetary easing in 2026 Given these factors, even a marginal portfolio realignment — an increase of just 2–5% in gold allocation — across institutional or high-net-worth portfolios could generate significant incremental demand. For context, every 1% shift in global asset allocation toward gold represents hundreds of tonnes of additional demand, which historically has had a multiplicative price impact due to the market’s limited float and thin elasticity.

      "China CPI inflation edged up but remained in deflation China's CPI inflation edged up in September, but the economy remained in deflation. The main reason is a continued slide in food prices down to -4.4% YoY, a 20-month low. This is, in part, base effect-driven, as MoM prices actually picked up 0.7%. The primary culprit has been pork (-17%), which is currently in a downward trend and likely to continue dragging food inflation for several more months. On a YoY basis, we continued to see notable drags from vegetable (-13.7%), egg (-11.9%), and fruit (-4.2%) prices despite MoM gains for each of these categories. The drag from these categories may persist in October, but should ease from November onward, helping to support a turnaround of food inflation. The silver lining in the data was that non-food inflation picked up to 0.7% YoY, up for a fourth consecutive month despite a -0.1% MoM dip."

Industrial modernisation, tech self-sufficiency and innovation feature prominently We have seen a bit of a shift in the order of priorities compared to the 14th Five-Year Plan.

      "Historically, gold’s share in large institutional and sovereign portfolios has remained remarkably stable — typically in the range of 8–12% for diversified funds and 3–5% for traditional multi-asset portfolios. Despite major macro shifts over the past decade — from negative interest rates to post-pandemic tightening — the structural allocation to gold has not changed materially. However, the current global investment climate presents a notably different backdrop: • Elevated geopolitical uncertainty (U.S.–China trade realignments, Middle East tensions, and rising nuclear risk rhetoric) • Persistently high fiscal deficits across major economies, leading to currency debasement fears • Increasing volatility in both equity and bond markets due to diverging monetary policies • Declining real yields and renewed expectations of monetary easing in 2026 Given these factors, even a marginal portfolio realignment — an increase of just 2–5% in gold allocation — across institutional or high-net-worth portfolios could generate significant incremental demand. For context, every 1% shift in global asset allocation toward gold represents hundreds of tonnes of additional demand, which historically has had a multiplicative price impact due to the market’s limited float and thin elasticity. Estimated target for end-2025 Putting all this together, a reasonable base-case target could be in the US $4,200-$4,600/oz range by end-2025, assuming no major shock."

      "Historically, gold’s share in large institutional and sovereign portfolios has remained remarkably stable — typically in the range of 8–12% for diversified funds and 3–5% for traditional multi-asset portfolios.

However, the current global investment climate presents a notably different backdrop: • Elevated geopolitical uncertainty (U.S.–China trade realignments, Middle East tensions, and rising nuclear risk rhetoric) • Persistently high fiscal deficits across major economies, leading to currency debasement fears • Increasing volatility in both equity and bond markets due to diverging monetary policies • Declining real yields and renewed expectations of monetary easing in 2026 Given these factors, even a marginal portfolio realignment — an increase of just 2–5% in gold allocation — across institutional or high-net-worth portfolios could generate significant incremental demand.

      "Fourth Plenum, Xi-Trump summit, and PBOC are potential catalysts to watch The stronger-than-expected third-quarter data mean that, barring a dramatic deceleration in 4Q, China will likely manage to reach its full-year target of \"around 5%\" growth. Domestically, the Fourth Plenum meetings this week are likely to give some insights into China's 15th Five-Year Plan. The full text will not be available until the plan is formally approved at the Two Sessions next year. This plan will offer some insight into how China plans to navigate an increasingly difficult external environment. Investors will likely watch closely for signs of concrete steps to boost consumption, as well as areas for tech development and focus. The long-awaited and high-stakes Xi-Trump meeting next week in South Korea looks likely to take place despite the recent escalations in US-China friction. Language and signalling suggest that both sides would prefer to reach some sort of agreement to continue the current uneasy truce rather than see a re-escalation back to, or beyond, this year's peak tensions in April-May. The odds of miscalculation remain, though, representing a potential downside risk to the outlook. While we see a diminishing marginal impact from further tariff hikes, the prospects of non-tariff escalations represent a notable uncertainty."

      "Historically, gold’s share in large institutional and sovereign portfolios has remained remarkably stable — typically in the range of 8–12% for diversified funds and 3–5% for traditional multi-asset portfolios. Despite major macro shifts over the past decade — from negative interest rates to post-pandemic tightening — the structural allocation to gold has not changed materially. However, the current global investment climate presents a notably different backdrop: • Elevated geopolitical uncertainty (U.S.–China trade realignments, Middle East tensions, and rising nuclear risk rhetoric) • Persistently high fiscal deficits across major economies, leading to currency debasement fears • Increasing volatility in both equity and bond markets due to diverging monetary policies • Declining real yields and renewed expectations of monetary easing in 2026 Given these factors, even a marginal portfolio realignment — an increase of just 2–5% in gold allocation — across institutional or high-net-worth portfolios could generate significant incremental demand. For context, every 1% shift in global asset allocation toward gold represents hundreds of tonnes of additional demand, which historically has had a multiplicative price impact due to the market’s limited float and thin elasticity. Estimated target for end-2025 Putting all this together, a reasonable base-case target could be in the US $4,200-$4,600/oz range by end-2025, assuming no major shock.",
