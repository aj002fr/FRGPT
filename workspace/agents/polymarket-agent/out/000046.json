          "description": "On March 17, sitting Minnesota State Senator Justin Eichorn was arrested for allegedly soliciting sex from a 16 year old. You can read more about that here: https://minnesotareformer.com/2025/03/18/gop-state-sen-justin-eichorn-arrested-for-suspicion-of-soliciting-sex-with-a-16-year-old-girl/\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Rojas is found guilty on any charge relating to soliciting a minor sexual activity in this case by February 28, 2026, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf Eichorn is never charged with soliciting a minor for sexual activity in this case, or otherwise all charges related to soliciting a minor for sexual activity in this case are dismissed, end due to a plea agreement without an admission of guilt, or if a mistrial is declared for the relevant charges, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf all solicitation of a minor charges dismissed at any point, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market will resolve according to the initial judgment rendered in this case. Any appeals will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be an official judgement delivered by the ruling court; however, other credible reporting may be used.\n",
