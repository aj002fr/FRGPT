            "description": "On March 31, President of the French National Rally parliamentary group Marine Le Pen was sentenced to 4 years in prison, 2 of which are suspended, and fined €100,000. Additionally, she has been banned from running for office for 5 years. She is expected to appeal the case. You can read more about that here: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyq40yz70qo\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Marine Le Pen receives a reduced sentence as a result of a formal appeal decision by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\n A reduced sentence includes any official change that lessens the severity or length of the original sentence, such as a shorter prison term, a reduced fine, or restoration of Le Pen's eligibility to run for public office.\n\nThe reduced sentence must apply to the referenced case, where she was convicted of \"Abuse of Public Funds\".\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be information from the government of France, however a consensus of credible reporting will also be used.\n\n",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nBelow 98 cents means all candles in the period have a final “High” price below 0.98000 (i.e. 0.97999 or lower).

To see the “High” prices, mouse over particular candles and look at the value after “H” at the top of the chart.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Coinbase USDT-USD.
