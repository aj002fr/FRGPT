Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No.”\n\nThis market may resolve to \"Yes\" immediately after the statement from the Fed's December 2025 meeting has been released if there has been exactly 2 rate cuts by then.\n\nFor example, if the FED cuts rates by 50 bps after a meeting, it would be considered 2 cuts (of 25 bps each).
